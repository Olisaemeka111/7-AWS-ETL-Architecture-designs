# Architecture 4: EMR Batch ETL

## Overview
This architecture implements a big data ETL pipeline using Amazon EMR for large-scale data processing with Hadoop/Spark clusters, designed for handling very large datasets and complex transformations.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components
- **Data Sources**: S3, HDFS, databases
- **Processing**: Amazon EMR (Hadoop/Spark cluster)
- **Storage**: S3 Data Lake
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow on EMR or Step Functions
- **Notebooks**: EMR Notebooks or SageMaker
- **Monitoring**: EMR console and CloudWatch

## 🔄 Data Flow
1. EMR cluster provisions on demand or persistent
2. Spark/Hadoop jobs extract data from sources
3. Large-scale parallel transformations
4. Data quality validation and cleansing
5. Partitioned data written to S3
6. Optional: Load summary data to Redshift

## ✅ Benefits
- Handles very large datasets (TB to PB)
- Full Hadoop ecosystem available
- Flexible cluster sizing
- Support for multiple processing frameworks

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Big data processing
- Complex machine learning pipelines
- Historical data migration
- Advanced analytics workloads

## 🚧 Status: In Development

This architecture is currently being implemented. The following components will be included:

### Planned Components
- **Terraform Infrastructure**: Complete EMR cluster setup
- **EMR Cluster**: Auto-scaling Spark/Hadoop cluster
- **Spark Jobs**: Large-scale data processing jobs
- **Airflow Integration**: Workflow orchestration
- **S3 Data Lake**: Optimized storage for big data
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive cluster monitoring

### Expected Features
- Auto-scaling EMR clusters
- Spark-based data processing
- Integration with Airflow for orchestration
- Cost optimization with Spot instances
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## 🚀 Quick Start (Coming Soon)

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Python 3.9+
- Spark knowledge

### Deployment (Planned)
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 💰 Cost Estimation (Planned)
- **EMR Cluster**: ~$0.27 per vCPU-hour + EC2 costs
- **EC2 Instances**: Variable based on instance types
- **S3 Storage**: ~$0.023 per GB stored
- **Data Transfer**: Variable based on usage
- **Total**: ~$300-600/month (depending on cluster size)

## 📊 Monitoring (Planned)
- EMR cluster metrics
- Spark job performance
- S3 storage metrics
- Cost monitoring and optimization
- Cluster health and scaling events
