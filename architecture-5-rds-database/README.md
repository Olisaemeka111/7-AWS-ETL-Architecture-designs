# Architecture 5: RDS Database ETL

## Overview
This architecture implements a database-centric ETL pipeline using Amazon RDS/Aurora with stored procedures for transformations, designed for SQL-heavy workloads and transactional data processing.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components
- **Data Sources**: Multiple databases, APIs, files
- **Processing**: Amazon RDS/Aurora with stored procedures
- **Staging**: Dedicated staging database
- **Orchestration**: AWS Data Pipeline or Step Functions
- **Storage**: RDS → S3 → Redshift
- **Monitoring**: RDS Performance Insights

## 🔄 Data Flow
1. Data Pipeline orchestrates extraction
2. Source data pulled into staging RDS
3. SQL-based transformations in database
4. Data validation and quality checks
5. Transformed data exported to S3
6. Final load to data warehouse

## ✅ Benefits
- Familiar SQL-based transformations
- ACID transaction support
- Existing database skills utilization
- Strong consistency guarantees

## 🎯 Use Cases
- SQL-heavy transformation logic
- Transactional data processing
- Legacy system integration
- Regulatory compliance requirements

## 🚧 Status: In Development

This architecture is currently being implemented. The following components will be included:

### Planned Components
- **Terraform Infrastructure**: RDS/Aurora cluster setup
- **Staging Database**: Dedicated staging environment
- **Stored Procedures**: SQL-based transformations
- **Data Pipeline**: Orchestration and scheduling
- **S3 Integration**: Data export and staging
- **Monitoring**: RDS performance monitoring

### Expected Features
- Multi-database source integration
- SQL-based data transformations
- Transactional data processing
- Data quality validation
- Automated scheduling and orchestration

## 🚀 Quick Start (Coming Soon)

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform >= 1.0
- SQL knowledge
- Database administration experience

### Deployment (Planned)
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 💰 Cost Estimation (Planned)
- **RDS/Aurora**: ~$0.10-0.50 per hour (depending on instance type)
- **S3 Storage**: ~$0.023 per GB stored
- **Data Transfer**: Variable based on usage
- **Data Pipeline**: ~$1.00 per pipeline per month
- **Total**: ~$100-300/month (depending on instance size)

## 📊 Monitoring (Planned)
- RDS performance metrics
- Database connection monitoring
- Query performance analysis
- Storage utilization tracking
- Cost monitoring and optimization
