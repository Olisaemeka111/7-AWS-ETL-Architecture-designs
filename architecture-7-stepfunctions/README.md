# Architecture 7: Step Functions ETL

## Overview
This architecture implements an orchestrated ETL pipeline using AWS Step Functions to coordinate complex multi-step workflows, combining different processing engines for different data types and requirements.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components
- **Data Sources**: Multiple heterogeneous sources
- **Orchestration**: AWS Step Functions
- **Processing**: Combination of Lambda, Glue, EMR
- **Storage**: S3 for staging and final storage
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry and error states
- **Monitoring**: Step Functions execution history

## 🔄 Data Flow
1. Step Function state machine defines workflow
2. Parallel extraction from multiple sources
3. Different processing engines for different data types
4. Data validation and quality gates
5. Conditional logic for error handling
6. Final aggregation and loading

## ✅ Benefits
- Visual workflow definition
- Built-in error handling and retries
- Coordinated parallel processing
- Audit trail of executions

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Mixed processing requirements
- Error-prone data sources
- Compliance and audit requirements

## 🚧 Status: In Development

This architecture is currently being implemented. The following components will be included:

### Planned Components
- **Terraform Infrastructure**: Step Functions and supporting services
- **State Machine**: Workflow definition and orchestration
- **Lambda Functions**: Custom processing steps
- **Glue Integration**: Managed ETL processing
- **EMR Integration**: Big data processing steps
- **Monitoring**: Step Functions execution monitoring

### Expected Features
- Visual workflow orchestration
- Parallel and sequential processing
- Built-in error handling and retries
- Conditional branching logic
- Comprehensive execution logging

## 🚀 Quick Start (Coming Soon)

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Python 3.9+
- Workflow orchestration knowledge

### Deployment (Planned)
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 💰 Cost Estimation (Planned)
- **Step Functions**: ~$0.000025 per state transition
- **Lambda**: ~$0.20 per 1M requests + compute time
- **Glue**: ~$0.44 per DPU-hour
- **EMR**: ~$0.27 per vCPU-hour + EC2 costs
- **Total**: ~$100-400/month (depending on workflow complexity)

## 📊 Monitoring (Planned)
- Step Functions execution metrics
- State transition monitoring
- Error rate tracking
- Execution duration analysis
- Cost monitoring and optimization
