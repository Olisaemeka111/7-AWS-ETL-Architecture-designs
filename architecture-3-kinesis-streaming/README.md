# Architecture 3: Kinesis Streaming ETL

## Overview
This architecture implements a real-time streaming ETL pipeline using Amazon Kinesis for data ingestion and processing, with Kinesis Analytics for stream transformations and Kinesis Data Firehose for data delivery.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components
- **Data Sources**: Application logs, IoT devices, databases (CDC)
- **Ingestion**: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
- **Processing**: Kinesis Data Analytics or Lambda
- **Storage**: Kinesis Data Firehose → S3 → Redshift
- **Real-time Views**: Amazon OpenSearch (Elasticsearch)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch and Kinesis Analytics metrics

## 🔄 Data Flow
1. Data producers send to Kinesis Data Streams
2. Kinesis Analytics processes streaming data
3. Real-time transformations and aggregations
4. Processed data sent to Firehose
5. Firehose buffers and loads to S3/Redshift
6. Near real-time dashboards from OpenSearch

## ✅ Benefits
- Real-time data processing
- High throughput and low latency
- Built-in scaling and partitioning
- Multiple consumption patterns

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Real-time analytics
- IoT data processing
- Log analysis
- Fraud detection
- Live dashboards

## 🚧 Status: In Development

This architecture is currently being implemented. The following components will be included:

### Planned Components
- **Terraform Infrastructure**: Complete infrastructure as code
- **Kinesis Data Streams**: Real-time data ingestion
- **Kinesis Analytics**: Stream processing with SQL
- **Kinesis Data Firehose**: Data delivery to destinations
- **Lambda Functions**: Custom stream processing
- **OpenSearch**: Real-time search and analytics
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboards and alerts

### Expected Features
- Real-time data ingestion from multiple sources
- Stream processing with Kinesis Analytics
- Automatic scaling based on data volume
- Real-time dashboards and alerting
- Data archival and backup strategies

## 🚀 Quick Start (Coming Soon)

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Python 3.9+

### Deployment (Planned)
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 💰 Cost Estimation (Planned)
- **Kinesis Data Streams**: ~$0.014 per shard-hour
- **Kinesis Analytics**: ~$0.11 per KPU-hour
- **Kinesis Data Firehose**: ~$0.029 per GB ingested
- **OpenSearch**: ~$0.10 per hour for t3.small.search
- **Total**: ~$50-200/month (depending on data volume)

## 📊 Monitoring (Planned)
- Kinesis stream metrics
- Analytics processing metrics
- Firehose delivery metrics
- OpenSearch cluster health
- Real-time alerting
