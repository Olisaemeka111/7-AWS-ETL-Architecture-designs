# Architecture 6: Containerized ETL with ECS

## Overview
This architecture implements a containerized ETL pipeline using Amazon ECS for custom business logic and multi-language processing, providing flexibility and portability across environments.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components
- **Data Sources**: Various APIs, databases, files
- **Container Platform**: Amazon ECS or EKS
- **Processing**: Custom containers with ETL logic
- **Orchestration**: AWS Batch or Kubernetes Jobs
- **Storage**: S3, EFS for shared data
- **Registry**: Amazon ECR for container images

## 🔄 Data Flow
1. Batch or Kubernetes job schedules containers
2. Containers pull data from multiple sources
3. Custom business logic for transformations
4. Parallel processing across multiple containers
5. Results aggregated and stored
6. Container cleanup and resource deallocation

## ✅ Benefits
- Language and framework flexibility
- Portable across environments
- Fine-grained resource control
- Easy to version and deploy

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Complex custom logic
- Multi-language processing
- Microservices architecture
- Hybrid cloud deployments

## 🚧 Status: In Development

This architecture is currently being implemented. The following components will be included:

### Planned Components
- **Terraform Infrastructure**: ECS cluster and services
- **Docker Containers**: Custom ETL processing containers
- **ECR Repository**: Container image registry
- **ECS Services**: Container orchestration
- **EFS Storage**: Shared file system
- **Monitoring**: Container and service monitoring

### Expected Features
- Multi-language container support
- Auto-scaling container services
- Custom business logic processing
- Shared storage for data exchange
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging

## 🚀 Quick Start (Coming Soon)

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Docker knowledge
- Container orchestration experience

### Deployment (Planned)
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## 💰 Cost Estimation (Planned)
- **ECS Tasks**: ~$0.04048 per vCPU-hour + $0.004445 per GB-hour
- **ECR Storage**: ~$0.10 per GB per month
- **EFS Storage**: ~$0.30 per GB per month
- **Data Transfer**: Variable based on usage
- **Total**: ~$150-300/month (depending on usage)

## 📊 Monitoring (Planned)
- ECS service metrics
- Container performance monitoring
- ECR image scanning
- EFS storage metrics
- Cost monitoring and optimization
